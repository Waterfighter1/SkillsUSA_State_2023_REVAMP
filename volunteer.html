            <p class="infoText">We welcome volunteers of all ages, but
                those under 18 must volunteer with a family member.<br>
                To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete
                the Volunteer Application2017. Complete it and bring with you to orientation.<br>
                Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor
                who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you
                will be certified to volunteer on your own.</p>
            <h2 class="infoHeader">A Few Notes:</h2>

                    </li>
