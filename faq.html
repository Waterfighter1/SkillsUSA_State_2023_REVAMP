                    <p> Will you take my animal in? </p>
                </div>



                <div class="answer">
                    <p> First thing we ask no matter what, “Where do you live?” If you do not live in the city limits they cannot bring an animal in. If animal is found within the city limits, they have to now sign an affidavit that they found the dog inside the city limits, 
                        we have those forms at the shelter.  Any person in the County portion of Wilson County needing animal control can call them at 615-444-9775.

                    <p>Okay, my animal is a cat</p> 
                </div>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p> We are no longer accepting cats unless they are critically injured/sick or 'without a mother. New Leash on Life may be able to help with some cats and dogs they are 615-444-1144. Country K-9 is in Lebanon and they can sometimes help with cats but mainly just dogs. </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <p> Do you spay your adopted animals? </p>
                </div>



                <div class="answer">
                    <p> No animal will leave our shelter unaltered. The animals must be fixed no exceptions. If the animal being adopted is already fixed it is a 75 dollar fee and they can go home right away. If the animal is not altered, it is a 25 dollar fee and WE take the dog to the vet of the owner's choice within the city limits of Mt. Pleasant only. The new owner will pay for the spay or neuter of the animal. The cost of that depends on if the adopted animal is male/female- cat/dog and which vet they go to. We have a price list for each vet. </p>
