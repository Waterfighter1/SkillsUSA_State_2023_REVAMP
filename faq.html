                <h3 class="Question">Will you take my animal in?</h3>
                <p class="Answer"> First thing we ask no matter what, “Where do you live?” If you do
                    not live in the city limits they cannot bring an animal in. If animal is found within the city
                    limits, they have to now sign an affidavit that they found the dog inside the city limits, we have
                    those forms at the shelter. We are no longer accepting cats unless they are critically injured/sick
                    or 'without a mother. Any person in the County portion of Wilson County needing animal
                    control can call them at 615-444-9775. New Leash on Life may be able to help with some cats
                    and dogs they are 615-444-1144. Country K-9 is in Lebanon and they can sometimes help with
                    cats but mainly just dogs.</p>

                <h3 class="Question">Adoptions?</h3>
                <p class="Answer">No animal will leave our shelter unaltered. The animals must be fixed no exceptions.
                    If the animal being adopted is already fixed it is a 75 dollar fee and they can go home right away.
                    If the animal is not altered, it is a 25 dollar fee and WE take the dog to the vet of the owner's
                    choice within the city limits of Mt. Pleasant only. The new owner will pay for the spay or neuter
                    of the animal. The cost of that depends on if the adopted animal is male/female- cat/dog and
                    which vet they go to. We have a price list for each vet.</p>

                <h3 class="Question">Community service?</h3>
                <p class="Answer">Ff it is for school or court ordered. If court ordered they must first go down
                    to PD and speak with Lt. Chandler or Chief. They will give them their paperwork to begin
                    working. The best time to start is at 8 am as there is not much cleaning to be done in the
                    afternoon. They are not allowed to come in contact with the animals. They will be sweeping,
                    mopping, and doing dishes. The front doors will be closed so they need to come into the side
                    door by the large garage door.
